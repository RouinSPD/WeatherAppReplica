# WeatherAppReplica

## Overview

WeatherAppReplica is a project aimed at learning and demonstrating how to use Apple's WeatherKit and replicating the user interface of the native iOS Weather app. The project includes various features such as hourly forecasts, 10-day forecasts, "feels like" temperature, humidity, visibility, and UV index. Additionally, it features an animated background that changes depending on the hour and the current weather conditions.

## Features

- **Hourly Forecast**: Displays the weather forecast for each hour.
- **10-Day Forecast**: Shows the weather forecast for the next 10 days.
- **Feels Like Temperature**: Provides the "feels like" temperature.
- **Humidity**: Displays the current humidity levels.
- **Visibility**: Shows the current visibility.
- **UV Index**: Displays the current UV index.
- **Animated Background**: The background changes dynamically based on the current hour and weather conditions.
